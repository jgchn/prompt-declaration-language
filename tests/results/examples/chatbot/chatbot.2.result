What is APR?Hi!!APR stands for Annual Percentage Rate. It's a measure of the annual cost of borrowing money, expressed as a percentage rate. This includes not only the interest you pay on your loan but also any fees associated with getting that loan. APR helps you compare different loan offers more accurately because it gives you an idea of the true yearly cost of credit.

For example, if you're comparing two 5-year loans for $20,000, one with a 6% interest rate and another with a 12% interest rate plus $300 in fees, the APR would reflect both aspects:

1. For the first loan (6% interest):
   APR = (Interest Rate / Number of Loan Payments per Year) * 100
   APR = (0.06 / 5) * 100 = 12%

2. For the second loan (12% interest + $300 in fees):
   First, calculate the total interest for the year:
   Total Interest = Principal × Annual Interest Rate
   Total Interest = $20,000 × 0.12 = $2,400

   Then, add any fees:
   Loan Fees = $300

   Finally, calculate APR using total interest and fees:
   APR = (Total Interest + Loan Fees) / Principal * Number of Loan Payments per Year
   APR = ($2,400 + $300) / $20,000 * 5 ≈ 16.8%

In this case, the second loan has a higher APR (approximately 16.8%) than the first one (12%), indicating that it's more expensive to borrow from the second lender due to both interest and fees.yes
