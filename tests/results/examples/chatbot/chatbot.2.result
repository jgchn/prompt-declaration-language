What is APR?Hi!APR stands for Annual Percentage Rate. It's a measure of the annual cost of borrowing money, expressed as a percentage. This includes not only the interest you pay on your loan but also any fees associated with getting that loan. APR helps consumers compare different loan offers more accurately because it gives them an idea of the true yearly cost of credit.

For example, if you're considering two loans with different terms and interest rates, calculating their APRs will allow you to see which one is actually cheaper when factoring in all costs over a year. This makes it easier for borrowers to make informed decisions about the best loan options for their financial situations.yes
