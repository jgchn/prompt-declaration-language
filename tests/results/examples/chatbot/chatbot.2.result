What is APR?Hello!!APR stands for Annual Percentage Rate. It's a measure of the annual cost of borrowing money, expressed as a percentage rate. This includes not only the interest you pay on your loan but also any fees associated with obtaining that loan. APR helps consumers compare different loan offers more accurately because it gives them an idea of the true yearly cost of credit.

For example, if you're considering two loans: one with a 10% annual interest rate and another with a 5% annual fee, the APR would reflect both components to give you a clearer picture of which loan is more expensive over a year. The higher the APR, the more costly it will be to borrow money on that particular loan.

APR is typically used for consumer credit like mortgages, auto loans, and personal loans. It's important to note that while APR can help in comparing loans, other factors such as loan term, fees, and the type of interest (simple or compound) should also be considered when making a decision.yes
